    <h1>The Power of Student Unity</h1>
    <p>Unity among students is more than a shared classroom—it's the foundation of real societal change. When students stand together, ideas evolve into actions, and voices blend into a powerful force for good.</p>
    <p>Movements throughout history have been sparked by student energy. From fighting for educational equity to demanding social justice, student unity has the ability to spark revolutions. It begins with believing in each other and ends with transforming communities.</p>
    <p>In our Fataatuu Dream community, unity is everything. We believe that together we dream bigger, think deeper, and build stronger. It’s not just about academics — it’s about the future we create side by side.</p>
    <p>If you're reading this, you're part of the mission. Let's unite, uplift, and unleash our shared potential.</p>
